Note on ext/stem/tests:

If you want more extensive tests than the quick
ones provided here, head to 

  http://www.tutorbuddy.com/software/
  
and look for the download for 

  stem-php-tests-x.tar.gz

If you've already gone and downloaded the tests,
just un-gzip them in ext/stem/tests and go nuts
with run-tests.php.
