stem -- a PHP extension that provides word stemming.
Version 1.3.

0. What is it?

	Basically, a word stemmer takes a word and strips it of its suffix.
	(Or suffixes.) Words like "assassination", "assassinations",
	"assassinate" and "assassinated" all have the same base -- "assassin".
	A word stemmer breaks each of the aforementioned words down to their
	common base.

	The stem extension for PHP provides this capability for a variety of
	languages using Dr. M.F. Porter's Snowball API, which can be found at

	  http://snowball.sourceforge.net


1. What is it good for?

	The idea behind stemming is to increase the efficiency of information
	retrieval by combining similar words. This has a couple of advantages
	in, say, a typical search engine:

	* You can reduce the size of your database/keyword list. There's no
	  reason to store "physics", "physicist" and "physical" when you
	  can just store "physic" and provide more or less the same results.
	  This can decrease the search time as well as decrease the physical
	  size of the database.

	* Provide more generalized results. If a user searches on "assassins",
	  it's easy to provide them results with words like "assassinated",
	  "assassinations" and "assassin", since they all work out to the same
	  thing after stemming.

	There are lots of uses for stemming in the IR world. You can read up
	on them at Dr. Porter's Snowball site.


2. Why?

	When I was first hired for my current job, I had to quickly pound
	together a dynamic web site/application combined with a search engine.
	I had about a month to do it. So I hammered it all together in PHP.

	The search engine was pretty terrible at first, but eventually I
	prettied it up, adding a lot of features like Boolean syntax, the ability
	to run as a "daemon"-type service, and the ability to serve XML documents
	for results, thus freeing it from it's web interface and making it
	implementation independent.

	Another feature I added after reading Dr. Porter's "An algorithm for
	suffix stemming" article, first featured in "Program". (Although I read
	it in "Readings in Information Retrieval", a collection of IR works by
	K.S. Jones and P. Willett.)

	My own implementation of Porter's stemmer went through several variations,
	none of which were 100% correct, which wasn't a total surprise. (Porter's
	site recants many malformed implementations.)

	I finally hit it dead on after re-writing my crappy little stemmer in C
	as a PHP module using standard POSIX regexes. After pumping some 50,000
	words through the module and comparing it with Porter's own stemmer
	(also written in C), I came up with identical results. (His was a bit
	faster, though, which is to be expected considering the extra layers
	of abstration PHP and Zend required.)

	Eventually I realized we'd probably need a French stemmer, seeing as
	I work for a Canadian company. So back to the drawing board I went.

	By this time, Dr. Porter's Snowball project was well underway. After
	discovering it, I decided to pack a bunch of languages into one PHP
	extension -- stem.


3. How do you use it?

	There are two basic prototypes for the stem extension:

		string stem(string word [, int language])
		string stem_LANGUAGE(string word)

	Both prototypes have the same return values: the stemmed word on success,
	and false should some kind of Snowball error occur. (An E_NOTICE is
	also raised on various errors.)

	In the first prototype, language can be one of the following:

	STEM_DANISH
	STEM_DUTCH
	STEM_ENGLISH -- enhanced Porter stemming algorithm
	STEM_FRENCH
	STEM_GERMAN
	STEM_ITALIAN
	STEM_NORWEGIAN
	STEM_PORTER -- the original Porter stemming algorithm
	STEM_PORTUGUESE
	STEM_RUSSIAN
	STEM_SPANISH
	STEM_SWEDISH

	By default, STEM_PORTER is used.

	In the second prototype variation, you can use the following forms:

	stem_danish
	stem_dutch
	stem_english
	stem_french
	stem_german
	stem_italian
	stem_norwegian
	stem_porter
	stem_portuguese
	stem_russian
	stem_spanish
	stem_swedish

	Each function will accept and return strings in standard Latin encodings
	except for Russian, which uses Cyrillic KO18-R encoding.

	More languages may follow, and perhaps some aliases (like stem_francais()
	will be equivalent to stem_french(). Who knows.)

	A quick example:

	<?php

	print "Original porter (default): assassinations -> " . stem("assassinations") . "\n";
	print "English: devestating -> " . stem("devestating", STEM_ENGLISH) . "\n";
	print "French: majestueusement -> " . stem("majestueusement", STEM_FRENCH) . "\n";
	print "Spanish: chicharrones -> " . stem("chicharrones", STEM_SPANISH) . "\n";
	print "Dutch: lichamelijkheden -> " . stem("lichamelijkheden", STEM_DUTCH) . "\n";
	print "Danish: undersøgelsen -> " . stem_danish("undersøgelsen") . "\n";
	print "German: aufeinanderschlügen -> " . stem_german("aufeinanderschlügen") . "\n";
	print "Italian: pronunciamento -> " . stem_italian("pronunciamento") . "\n";
	print "Norwegian: havnemyndighetene -> " . stem_norwegian("havnemyndighetene") . "\n";
	print "Portuguese: quilométricas -> " . stem_portuguese("quilométricas") . "\n";
	print "Swedish: klostergården -> " . stem_swedish("klostergården") . "\n";

	?>

	Output:

	Original porter (default): assassinations -> assassin
	English: devestating -> devest
	French: majestueusement -> majestu
	Spanish: chicharrones -> chicharron
	Dutch: lichamelijkheden -> licham
	Danish: undersøgelsen -> undersøg
	German: aufeinanderschlügen -> aufeinanderschlüg
	Italian: pronunciamento -> pronunc
	Norwegian: havnemyndighetene -> havnemyndighet
	Portuguese: quilométricas -> quilométr
	Swedish: klostergården -> klostergård


4. How do you compile it?

	You compile it as you would any other PHP extension.

	On UNIX-like systems:

	0. Unpack the source into /path/to/php/ext.
	1. Run buildconf.
	2. Configure using the --enable-stem argument.
	3. Run make.


	On Windows systems:

	0. Unpack the source as above.
	1. Open up the VC++ 6 workspace or project provided and build
	   the DLL.
	2. To use the extension, either use the dl() function to load
	   the DLL or use the extension=php_stem.dll directive in your
	   php.ini file.


	I've tested this extension on the following systems:

	- Linux, using gcc 2.96 (yes, the Red Hat gcc) and PHP 4.1.2,
	  4.2.0RC2 and 4.2.0RC4.

	- Solaris 8 using gcc 2.95 and PHP 4.1.2.

	- Windows 2000 using Visual C++ 6 with service packs 2 and 5 and
	  PHP 4.1.2.
